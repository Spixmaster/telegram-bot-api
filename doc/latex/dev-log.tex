In some constructors (mainly for field \char`\"{}thumb\char`\"{}), I only look for a string value although Input\+File would also be possible but I do not know how they would send me that. This is nothing to worry about as it is not even intended that Telegram sends all objects to us. Some are just sent by us. There is only a field \char`\"{}result\char`\"{} in the J\+S\+ON object answer if the request was a success.
